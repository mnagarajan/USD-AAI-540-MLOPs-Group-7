# Weather Forecasting MLOps Pipeline using Amazon SageMaker

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for weather forecasting using Amazon SageMaker. The pipeline covers data ingestion, feature management, model training, model evaluation, model registry, batch inference, and monitoring.

The objective is to demonstrate the complete machine learning lifecycle following MLOps best practices.

## Problem Statement

Accurate weather forecasting plays a critical role in environmental monitoring, disaster preparedness, agriculture, transportation, and urban planning.

This project uses historical weather data to predict temperature values based on atmospheric conditions such as humidity, wind speed, visibility, and pressure.

---

## Dataset

Source: Historical Weather Dataset

Features Used:

* Humidity
* Wind Speed (km/h)
* Wind Bearing (degrees)
* Visibility (km)
* Pressure (millibars)

Target Variable:

* Temperature (C)

Dataset Processing:

* Data cleaning
* Missing value handling
* Feature selection
* Train-Test split
